It's Working barely !!!    


```python

# To get started you need to have 2 directories called "send" and "receive"
# on your working directory

# You can either create them manually or you can call for an empty object 
# from either SocketServer or SocketClient
# which will generate the required directories and test files.

"""
Example:
    ../send.py
"""

from socket_client import SocketClient

sample = SocketClient()
